SciMark 2.0 was developed by Roldan Pozo, and Bruce Miller at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The goal was to better understand the JVM/JIT behavior of various Java platforms for numerical computing. The benchmark is similar in spirit to the Matlab and Java Linpack benchmarks, both of which have proven to be very useful.
